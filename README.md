This project used two Arduino mega 2560s with two HiLetgo TB6612 Mosfet Adafruit motor shield v2 along with a Twotrees 
Stepper Motor Driver TB6600 4A 9-42V Nema 17/23 CNC Controller Single Axes Hybrid - Upgraded Version to drive a Motech 
NEMA motor MT-2303HS280AW stepper motor. 

To use this code, upload the arduino 1 code to the Arduino Mega 2560 controlling motors 1 to 4 of the OWI robot 
and the arduino 2 code to the other mega controlling the gripper and linear actuator driver. Run the MATLAB code
in Robot_project.m. The robot should pick up a piece of bread, place it in the toaster, depress the toaster, pick
that bread back up and place it on a plate.
